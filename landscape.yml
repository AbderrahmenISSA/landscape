                The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) Project defines a framework and set of standards for identifying and securing
                communications between application services. At its core, SPIFFE is:


                A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource
                Identifiers (URIs).


                A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.


                An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload API.


                The SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment), that in addition to the above, it:


                - Performs node and workload attestation.


                - Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.


                - Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.


                - Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication and encryption between workloads.


                - Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services meshes and cloud provider services.


                - Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous environments and administrative trust boundaries


                The SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to
                establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can
                also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                In today's business environment, rapidly delivering innovative customer experiences through differentiated applications and services is
                necessary for competitive advantage. As a result, organizations witness a change in how applications and services are being architected, built,
                and deployed. New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster, at scale. Services need to be built at high
                velocity and deployed on a vast plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming increasingly interdependent and
                interconnected to deliver a consistent customer experience.


                Organizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance,
                the pool of expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within existing solutions.


                For business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of
                managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate development and deployment by removing the need
                for developers to understand the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service communication.


                Technology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge when different technology stacks must come together and
                interoperate. Aligning on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with identity and authentication, simplifies
                the technical aspects of full interoperability and integration across multiple stacks.


                SPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity. By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate
                systems in different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN
                tunnels, one-o certificates, or shared credentials for use between such systems.

                CRI-O is a secure, performant, and stable Container Runtime Interface (CRI) implementation for the Kubelet to orchestrate Open Container
                Initiative (OCI) containers in production Kubernetes environments. CRI-O's scope is only targeted at Kubernetes, and thus can be performance
                optimized, rigorously tested and securely tuned for running containers, pods and images in Kubernetes clusters.
              summary_business_use_case: >
                CRI-O  is able to tune its behavior to that of the Kubelet, enabling features and performance gains through customization. It is tested against
                a suite of thousands of tests, including the suite of Kubernetes e2e tests, to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes workloads. It has long had
                security on the forefront of its design philosophy, enabling new security knobs and reducing the attack surface for the purposes of running
                containers in production.
              summary_release_rate: |
                Every 4 months, released in tandem with Kubernetes minor releases (CRI-O 1.x.y is released soon after Kubernetes 1.x.z).

                WasmEdge provides a high-performance, lightweight, secure, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native applications. It is an OCI
                compliant container that is integrated into Docker, containerd, crun and many Kubernetes projects.  Compared with traditional Linux container
                apps, WasmEdge apps are more secure, more portable, cold-start 100x faster and only take 1/10 of the space.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                WasmEdge improves cloud app’s operational efficiency by providing a secure, portable, fast, and lightweight alternative to traditional Linux
                containers. It allows microservice or servelsss applications to “scale to zero” — all computing resources can be made available on-demand, and
                “write once run anywhere”. It also works with existing container management infra and programming languages, and hence minimizing the cost of
                adoption and migration. It is great for running microservices and serverless functions embedded in data pipelines or SaaS platforms.

                K8GB is a powerful tool for managing global Kubernetes deployments and provides features such as load balancing, failover, and intelligent
                routing. K8GB works by creating a set of custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the Kubernetes cluster, which define the global traffic routing
                policies. These policies are used by K8GB to configure the DNS servers to route traffic to the appropriate cluster or region.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                K8GB (Kubernetes Global Balancer) is an open-source project that provides a global traffic management solution for Kubernetes clusters. It is
                designed to simplify the configuration and management of DNS-based traffic routing for multi-cluster and multi-region Kubernetes deployments. It
                makes Kubernetes-based applications resistant to regional-wide failures.

                Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating
                updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to
                integrate with Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports multi-tenancy and support for syncing an
                arbitrary number of Git repositories, among other long-requested features.
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                GitOps is the natural evolution of configuration as code. Businesses moving to Flux can deal with infrastructure at scale more easily, and allow
                their developers to focus on code, not on deployment problems. With its vast ecosystem of Flux integrations and being integrated into cloud
                offerings everywhere, adopting Flux can be adopted in virtually every setup.

                Keptn supports teams that build their next generation platform on Kubernetes by solving the following 3 major challenges:
                1: Tame observability tool complexity: Keptn unifies access to ALL observability data through a single metrics server
                2: Remove complex delivery pipeline logic: Keptn provides deployment lifecycle tasks natively in Kubernetes
                3: Root cause for deploy change impact: Keptn emits end-2-end telemetry data to understand and troubleshoot deployments
              summary_business_use_case: >-
                Engineering teams want to have flexibility and choose the best tool for their needs, creating complex pipelines that are hard to control and
                maintain. Using Keptn, teams can focus on the application code and forget about Deployment complexity and tool integration. Similarly, SREs can
                enforce their SLOs/SLAs at the application and microservice levels.
